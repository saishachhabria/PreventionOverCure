# PreventionOverCure

This project was the winner for the problem statement at SIH 2019.

This is a web application for preventative maintenance made using the Django framework for the company Goa Shipyard. 

The application monitors machines using sensors for humidity, temperature, etc., to observe patterns in the machine’s daily usage. The algorithm uses machine learning (Linear Support Vector Machines) to predict and pre-empt when a machine is about to breakdown and schedules it’s maintenance such that the machine's safety is ensured and supply chain is not hampered with. 

It takes into consideration factors like the production line, cost, grouping of maintenance from common suppliers, etc., while scheduling the maintenance. It also accounts for the scheduled maintenance for machines.
